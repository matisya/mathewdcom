                        <h2 class="h2 poem-section-title">day boy 1: At the river</h2>
                        at the break of dawn off to the temple to seek the blessings of day boy
                        flowers in his hair a bandana sprouting chrysanthemums
                        eyelashes dripping holy ashes
                        taming the sun He
                        burning the waters

                        I witnessed the solar eclipse and I ejaculated
                        the hot white gleam descended and settled on the river bed
                        I jumped in
                        o but it was night
                        I wish I could be like you ladderless rudderless

                        day boy I admire your vine-swinging attitude
                        I know you drinking sun with bamboo straws
                        I’ve watched you roll, cataclysmic
                        upto a new thing everyday


                        <h2 class="h2 poem-section-title">day boy 2: Composition</h2>

                        people are made of dots. so are
                        chairs things trees, light even
                        is made of many dots.

                        day boy is one
                        dot.

                        thats why anything can become He
                        can become anything but for m
                        he is day boy.

                        concepts that are familiar such as

                        voices mean people
                        birds are the morning
                        an eye means a person

                        do not matter to day boy.
                        in the west he sees the sun
                        and decides now is the time for dreaming
                        and enters the cosy cove of a fish’s mouth
                        the fish swims the world.

                        who loves ideas ideas are his art.
                        who thinks of food and is hungry no more.
                        who can see the wind blow in a clear night sky.
                        who shakes stardust off his shoulders.
                        who does the day.

                        last I saw him
                        he was at the cemetery
                        correcting punctuation
                        on the tombstones.


                        <h2 class="h2 poem-section-title">day boy 3: Why the rain</h2>

                        mystical day boy.
                        climbing up a ladder to the Sun.
                        pop the top to drink the brilliant orange juice.
                        day boy drinks so much Sun he becomes the Sun. but now he wants to fall and he is too hot so he
                        becomes Girl and rains.

                        Girl falls to the water she is water.
                        Girl loves fish so she becomes fish.
                        in Girl’s mouth is a ring she refused to swallow as a child.
                        Girl exchanges the ring with a fisherman for a compass that points to the desert.

                        In the desert all there is is sand. but it is not sand that Girl is looking for. she is looking
                        for monk Toad. why is she looking for monk Toad? monk Toad will answer her most
                        burning question Why the rain.

                        but she must find monk Toad before the hot hot desert Sun, the desert Sun where there
                        are no hawks in the sky.

                        but monk Toad is secretly in love with Girl. he knows that if he tells her Why the rain
                        she will leave him forever. so he thinks her into an ice block made of diamonds so shiny
                        shinier than the Sun can penetrate. Girl, happy in whatever form is happy this way but
                        she still wants to know Why the rain.

                        Girl hatches an egg made of water droplets and gifts it to monk Toad so he will tell her
                        the answer. monk Toad drinks the egg in one enormous slurp and there is no more
                        water to be found anywhere. then he realises his mistake If there is no water how can
                        there be the Sun? with no Sun where the desert?

                        the world the whole world slips into an in-between the shape of a peach pit, hard and
                        dormant. monk Toad has no place to go so he goes nowhere. Girl is left alone and now
                        has all the time in the world all to herself so she closes her eyes to nap think and finds
                        herself in the ocean.

                        Girl remembers falling from way above. remembers her home in the cotton tree.
                        Grandmother used to make her pillows. When Grandmother died they wrapped her up
                        in her own pillows and set her in orbit.

                        Girl wonders where Grandmother is? If Grandmother will tell her Why the rain?

                        tired of thinking Girl falls asleep and melts into diamond droplets. When Girl wakes up
                        she sees a bright light day boy stands before her. he says It’s been a long time lets go,
                        and they both go away.
